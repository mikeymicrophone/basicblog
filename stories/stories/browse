Story: Some story about browsing

  As a user
  I want to find interesting information on each page and links to more
  So that I continue to use the site
  
  Scenario: Keep them clicking

    Given that the user is at a page they are not interested in
    When the user is thinking about whether to leave the site
    Then the user should see other items that are of interest
    And they should lead elsewhere within cw
    And they should include a mini profile
    And they should include geographically proximate topics
    And they should include recommended topics
    And they should include correlated topics
