JqueryOnRails
=============

jQuery on Rails allows you to separate out your jQuery files, and have them automatically
included as required by your markup.

It uses a custom version of hpricot to detect which JS files are needed.

jQuery on Rails builds a list of selectors from the JS files in your public/javascripts
directory once when the web server loads. If you modify your JS files, you will need to
restart the server.

IMPORTANT: You will need to add "map.jquery" to your routes file.

IMPORTANT: You will need to download and compile the hpricot gem from the jQuery
           svn (in trunk/tools/hpricot). You can compile it via rake install,
           but you will need to have ragel installed first (on OSX, use port
           to install it).
