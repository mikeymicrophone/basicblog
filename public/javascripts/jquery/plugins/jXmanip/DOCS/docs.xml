  <content title="Info">
    jXmanip is the jQuery XML manipulation framework.  It's a very flexible framework.<br />
    The premise is that you can write some jQuery code to transform the XML into anything (could be JSON, RSS, HTML, text)<br />
    And it's all server-side (client side coming soon)<br />

  <content title="Use">
    To start, make a folder in main, let's call it textify.<br />
    This will transform an XML file in to text.<br />
    The most important thing is our CONF.xml.<br />
    We'll need our root tag to be configuration<br />
    Inside of that, we need another tag, the conf tag<br />
    It's name attribute will be "make" and the value attribute will be "build.js"<br />
    This specifies the file which will be used to process the XML<br />
    More later!<br />
