  Scenario: I find what I searched for

    When the topic page loads
    Then I should find the information I wanted
    And I should find ways to navigate the rest of the site
    
  Scenario: I don't find what I searched for
    
    Given I search for a term found in a cw uri
    When the topic page loads
    And it doesn't have the information I wanted
