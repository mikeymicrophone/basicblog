Story: Creating a post
    As a user
    I want to post to my blog
    So that I can share information that would otherwise be void

  Scenario: anonymous user
    Given no blog posts in the system

    When I create a blog post

    Then the page should show the post's title
    And the page should show the post's body

  Scenario: cryptic user who doesn't title things

    When I create an untitled post

    Then I should see the new post page
    And my post should not be saved
    And my post should be in the body box
    And the title box should be highlighted
