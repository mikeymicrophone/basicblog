 * HubTest-BasicConformance.html:
 *		Test case for Ajax libraries that verifies whether a given library
 *		supports the most basic requirements from the OpenAjax Hub Specification.
 *
 *		To use this test case against a given Ajax library, this test case
 *		needs to be customized. At a minimum, you will need to replace the
 *		following line:
 *
 *			<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="SampleAjaxLibrary.js"></script>
 *
 *		with a <script> element that loads your Ajax library instead of SampleAjaxLibrary.js.
 *
 *		Libraries can make other modifications, but the <div> block
 *		with id=HubTest_BasicConformance" must be left intact.
 *
 *		Other customization instructions are included within the comments in the
 *		various files.

<!--	****************************************************************************
			The xmlns declarations are included in this test case below because they are required
			by the OpenAjax Hub Specification which is forward looking to when browsers
			support XML/XHTML properly. Note, however, that xmlns declarations generally have 
			no effect with browsers shipping at the time this test case was developed (early 2007).

			The xmlns:SampleAjaxLibrary declaration should be changed such that
				- "SampleAjaxLibrary" is changed to the prefix used by the given library
				- "http://example.com/SampleAjaxLibrary" is changed to the namespaceURI for the library
			(See documentation on OpenAjax.registerLibrary() for more about prefix and namespaceURI.)

				THE FOLLOWING SCRIPT ELEMENTS USUALLY NEED TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE HTML FILE.
				HERE IS THE LIST OF CUSTOMIZATIONS YOU MUST OR MAY DO TO THIS SECTION:

				YOU MUST CUSTOMIZE IT AS FOLLOWS.
					- You must change HubTest-BasicConformance-MyPrefix from "SampleAjaxLibrary"
							to the prefix used by your library.

				YOU MAY CUSTOMIZE THE FOLLOWING LOGIC AS FOLLOWS.
					- Your toolkit might include the OpenAjax Hub (i.e., ../../release/OpenAjax.js)
						within your toolkit distribution or might put the Hub source code in a different
						location than ../../release/OpenAjax.js. Therefore, it is OK to change
						the 'src' attribute or remove the SCRIPT tag for OpenAjax.js entirely
						(if you include the Hub within your toolkit).
						(But be aware that if the Hub is part of your toolkit, you probably have to move
						the SCRIPT tag for HubTest-BasicConformance.js such that it is loaded
						after your toolkit because it makes calls into various OpenAjax.* functions.)

					- If you are using a different implementation of the Hub than the 
						Alliance's reference implementation at http://openajaxallianc.sourceforge.net,
						and your library register load event handlers with the Hub,
						you probably need to change the logic within function HubTest_BasicConformance_Verify_Load()
						to look at your implementation's private variables.

					- Instead of having the ConformanceChecks() happen at the end of OnLoad processing

						performs some of its initialization after the OnLoad event has completed.
