In the near future, we are going to be adding support for runtimes.

This means, jXmanip will be able to run on the server *or* the client, 
seamlessly.  
This can be helpful for rapidly developing HTML from XML, or even text.  
When you are using a tool like sitemaker, it's easier to continually reload
a page rather than go to the terminal and run
./scripts/run -type sitemaker -file site.xml
and *then* reload.
